// User flow:
// 1: User changes <select id="city-type">
// 2: The page's background changes to a picture of the newly selected city

// Instructions:
// 1. Attach the .change() event method to #city-type;
// 2. Associate the above change event with a function, handleChange, which should do the following:
// 3. Create a variable, city, that stores the selected value of #city-type (hint: use .val())
// 4. Remove all classes from the <body> element using the .removeClass() method
// 5. The variable you created in step 4, corresponds to a CSS class (check in the sytle.css file for more info)
//    Use the .addClass() method to add this variable as a class to <body>

// Bonus: Apply the concept of $(this) - think about what element is causing .change() to fire
