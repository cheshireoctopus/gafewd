Temperature Converter

=== GOALS ===
1) Build a web app that converts fahrenheit to celsius, and vice versa.
2) Implement if/else statements that perform some sort of UI-change based on the user's input. For example, considering changing the background to blue for colder temps and red for higher temps.
3) Don't forget to make use of the `else if` operator!

=== CONSIDERATIONS ===
1) How will your users input the temperature? What sort of element should you use to capture this input?
2) What user action (browser event) will cause the conversion to happen? So far, we've seen .click() events - consider exploring key-based events: .keypress() or .keyup() or .keydown()

=== HINTS ===
- You will have to use parseInt() or parseFloat() to convert the user's input from a string to a number
- Formulas:
	Fahrenheit = Celsius * 1.8 + 32
	Celsis = (Fahrenheit - 32) / 1.8
